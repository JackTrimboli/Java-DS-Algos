SECTION 1 - INTRO:

Two types of Hash Tables:
1)Hash Set
    >Implementation of the 'Set' data structure which stores no repeat values
2)Hash Map
    >Implementation of the 'Map' data structure which stores pairs (key, value)

* can be imported and easily used through standard libaries *

SECTION 2 - THE PRINCIPLE OF HASH TABLE:

- key idea: map keys to buckets 
    1) When inserting a new key, the hash func decides which bucket to assign the key to and stores it
    2) When searching for a key, the hash table will use the SAME FUNCTION to find the corresponding bucket and search only in that bucket


SECTION 3 - DESIGN A HASHTABLE:
