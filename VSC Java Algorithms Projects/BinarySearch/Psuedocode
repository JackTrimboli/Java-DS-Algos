PROCEDURE: binarySearch(x , a)

INPUT: 
X: Value we're searching for
A: the array we're searching inside of

         P       Q       R
ARRAY: [| | | | | | | | | |]

Range of Array: A[P...R]

STEPS:

1) Give initial values to the range
    P = 0, R = a.length - 1

2) while P <= R, do:
    a)set q to be P+R/2 (Half the total number of slots AKA the midpoint. 
    Round down to the closest in value. EX: (0 + 9)/2 = 4.5 = 4, 4 would be the middle.)

    b)if A[Q] == x, exit loop and return index position of Q

    c)if A[q] > x, then 'x' is in the first half of the array. Set R to Q - 1
    else the value x > A[Q], and is in the second half. In this case, set P to Q + 1. 

3) else, return -1, value not in array.
