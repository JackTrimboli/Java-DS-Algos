CONDITION: data must be sorted.

Book Shelf Analogy: If we were performing a linear search, we would have to check each book in the shelf to 
find the one we're looking for. In the case of a BINARY SEARCH, the books would be sorted. Then, we could (for example)
search by the authors last name, making it much quicker. A binary search would start from the middle of the items
(or in this case, bookshelf). In this example, lets say the authors name in the middle of the bookshelf started with 'U'.
If we were looking for the author 'Shakespear', we could immediately ignore that whole second half of the shelf, 
which would mean we only halve to search half as many items. Instead of the speed being linear O(n), it would instead be
O(n/2).
